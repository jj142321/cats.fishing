# Abstract

Cats Fishing is a multiplayer fishing game, where anyone can fishing on several virtual islands, collect and build exciting items and meet new friends. Inspired by successful games, such as Animal Crossing, the game combines the best of the two worlds - a fun narrative for regular players who want to enjoy the gameplay experience as well as an ecosystem for players who want to collect and trade NFT:s, even if they have no idea what an NFT is.

**Cats Fishing is not just a game for blockchain players. But it’s a game that could introduce blockchain to millions of players.**

The game is aimed at the diverse gaming community which can get easily onboarded from regular platforms. Our main line of comparison lies within the traditional gaming market with the same players being targeted as our audience. We are innovating a new unobtrusive way of connecting an exciting game narrative to blockchain features. Cats Fishing has the potential to attract millions of gamers, and an associated greater opportunity for revenues.

The game is designed in a way to allow players to “own the game” by exercising power over the platform. Players also enjoy the democratic governance model based on a liquid democracy and real-world inspiration rules over a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

Cats Fishing has a first version that runs and plays well, and proves that the technology behind it works. The intent now is to fund this team further as a new company, developing Cats Fishing so it becomes a commercial success introducing millions of players to blockchain.
