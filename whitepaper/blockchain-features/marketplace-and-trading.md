# Marketplace & Trading

One advantage of decentralized ownership is that they can be traded on marketplaces outside of the game companies' influence. This can increase financial incentives for gamers to purchase and create items in the game. Naturally, this feature will be available with My Neighbor Alice.

Items can be traded in several marketplaces:

### In-game Marketplace <a href="#in-game-marketplace" id="in-game-marketplace"></a>

great casual experience in the graphic style of My Neighbor Alice. We believe this will be the first choice for a vast majority of the players, most of them come for the game itself more than for the blockchain elements, and they might not even know the difference. Note that this marketplace will also be blockchain based and ownership be with the players.

### External Marketplaces on Chromia <a href="#external-marketplaces-on-chromia" id="external-marketplaces-on-chromia"></a>

Items can also be read by the Chromia-developed marketplace. Chromia Market allows you to search for items based on data about assets, such as color and item-category. This is due to the fact that more data about assets are stored directly on the blockchain compared to many other blockchains.

### Marketplaces on other Blockchains <a href="#marketplaces-on-other-blockchains" id="marketplaces-on-other-blockchains"></a>

The ALICE token is interchangeable with an ERC-20 Ethereum token, but also items and item ownership might be transferred to other blockchains like binance smart chain.

In My Neighbor Alice, we strive to make items and item ownership interchangeable with other relevant blockchains. This is a way to increase interest and potentially liquidity, and can also be used for marketing purposes. The target group for My Neighbor Alice is however not primarily blockchain gamers, so this feature has a “minor” priority. The Chromia project, who support My Neighbor Alice, will fund and do this development as part of the Chromia platform. Also, we emphasize once more that Chromia Originals is richer in data compared to normal NFT:s, and the scope of interoperability will primarily target ownership rather than full asset data. In addition to Ethereum, other more gaming focused platforms are potential targets for interoperability development.

### Marketplace on Steam <a href="#marketplace-on-steam" id="marketplace-on-steam"></a>

My Neighbor Alice will use the existing game platforms, such as Steam, to sell items, in particular first hand items collections and in-game currencies. This is important for onboarding of non-cryptocurrency users. We believe that we have a strategy to make this comply with the terms of service.
