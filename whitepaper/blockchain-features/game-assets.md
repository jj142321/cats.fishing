# Game Assets

### Collectibles and Scarcity <a href="#collectibles-and-scarcity" id="collectibles-and-scarcity"></a>

In gaming, the element of scarcity and collectible items have been around since even before computers. Also in My Neighbor Alice, there will be limited editions, scarce items. In addition to items designed by the game developers, there will be user-generated content.

The openness of blockchain provides information about how many items exist in total, how large is a limited edition, etc. The additional openness of My Neighbor Alice's novel “decentralized assets” explained below improves on this further, as you can openly inspect similarity of items.

Scarcity in My Neighbor Alice exists on different levels:

* Fixed supply of land
* Limited editions of items
* Scarcity limits of user-generated content. Users acquire rights to generate items, these rights stipulate the max number of copies, thus enforcing scarcity requirements.

### Fully decentralized assets <a href="#fully-decentralized-assets" id="fully-decentralized-assets"></a>

In mainstream blockchain games, NFT consists of a small amount of binary data that represents ownership of an asset. But there are many more elements needed to actually having full control of an asset:

* How it looks
* Non-physical characteristics (strength of a sword, speed of a car)
* Game logic implementing the asset: Swinging a sword, driving a car

So far, in most blockchain games, this information is often stored elsewhere, not under the control of the player and instead under the full control of the game company. In My Neighbor Alice, we strive to improve on this as much as possible. So far blockchain games have been an emperor without clothes, we aim to dress him up with something cute.

My Neighbor Alice stores much more data about items on-chain, using the Chromia originals protocol, a standard for asset definitions. Also, the logic of items will be defined in a free/libre/open-source game, running on-chain and being under the ultimate control of the players, see the chapter on Community Council DAO.
