In the game, players could either purchase virtual plots from Alice or in the marketplace. There is a scarce supply of plots in the universe and each piece of land is represented in the form of NFT tokens. After the plot has been purchased, players can decorate it with various in-game items such as houses, lakes, decorations, animals, plants and other items that can be purchased additionally.

Lummelunda archipelago consists of six key islands:

**Snowflake Island**

Located on the northwestern edge of the Lummelunda archipelago, Snowflake island is a frosty wonderland filled with ice sculptures of mysterious origin. Fairy magic is found all around the place.

**Medieval Plains**

The Medieval Plains are anchored in an ancient time, with a landscape full of low vegetation and stonework. A great spot for your cows to graze. Did you know that Berta used to graze here?

**Nature's Rest**

Nature’s Rest is a dense forest with lush vegetation. Glowing lights fall from the trees and create a moody atmosphere. Nature's Rest also happens to be Bear’s (you know, the friendly bear with the yellow hat) birthplace

**Lummestad (The Town)**

The small but bustling town of the Lummelunda archipelago is full of shops and is the center point of many of the events in the game. The Town is located in the middle of the archipelago. This is the place where players will get to meet and interact with each other, buy and sell items and have fun together.

**Sandy Coast**

Made famous by local celebrities like Dr. Hilton, Sandy Coast resembles the Maldives. As the name suggests, the Sandy Coast is mostly composed of sand and includes multiple islands. This is the obvious destination for any beach dweller. Fancy a life on the beach, then this is the place for you!

**Submerged Islands**

The rich waters of the Submerged Islands are stalked by seafaring pirates, seeking the treasures and mysteries beneath the waves — or hunting those brave enough to try and get there first! Think shipwrecks, chests and driftwood. Something for the more adventurous minded perhaps? Ahoy there neighbor!
