### Staking Yield and Earnings <a href="#staking-yield-and-earnings" id="staking-yield-and-earnings"></a>

One of our strategic visions within My Neighbor Alice is to create monetary incentives for the most committed and motivated players.

#### Staking yield <a href="#staking-yield" id="staking-yield"></a>

Based on our staking and reward projections, we will allocate a fair amount of tokens on staking rewards. This will incentivize stakers to hold their tokens during the early stage of the game development while some significant game features will still be under development. Staking will progressively decrease as new features will be released.

#### NFT Collateral <a href="#nft-collateral" id="nft-collateral"></a>

In order to provide more liquidity to the collectors in Cats Fishing, we designed the collateral-filled NFTs, so that users could not only enjoy a monthly interest on their NFT holdings but also have access to instant liquidity when they want to liquidate the NFT.



When a user buys NFT from the system, a percentage of the purchase price might go into a collateral pool associated with NFT. User then has an option to sell it back to the system (i.e. destroy the NFT) for the price equivalent to the locked collateral (or a percentage of it). This guarantees that the value of NFT cannot go below a certain threshold. This feature will also allow a user to take a loan using NFT as a collateral.

#### Renting NFT <a href="#renting-nft" id="renting-nft"></a>

NFTs, including land, can be rented to other players. The smart contract will make sure that the borrower cannot resell or destroy the object, and makes sure that object returns to the owner when the rent period ends.
