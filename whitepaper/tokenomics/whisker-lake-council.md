# Whisker Lake Council

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

In line with an exciting plot and Cats Fishing also aims to become a truly user-owned game with its own Decentralized organization called Whisker Council governed by the community. Thus, we also integrated a concept of DAO, which over time can take over the majority of decision-making powers within the game. Whisker Council will be a crucial element of the game ecosystem which will address both in-game issues as well as the proposals connected to game development and future funding.

#### Membership <a href="#membership" id="membership"></a>

In principle, every BONES token holder can become a member of the Decentralised Organization and get the right to vote on proposals. At the same time, we understand that a certain number of players will be primarily interested in gaming and enjoying the “Whisker World”. We respect their decision, so membership in the Whisker Council will be optional.

#### Community Council principles <a href="#community-council-principles" id="community-council-principles"></a>

Designed as a consumer cooperative and a platform cooperative, the organization follows the universal principles:

* Voluntary membership, i.e. membership in Whisker Council is optional and fully depends on a player
* Democratic member control, i.e. Whisker Council has adopted liquid democracy as a model of participation
* Autonomy and independence, i.e. Whisker Council is expected to overtake the majority of in-game decision-making powers and stay free from third-party interference and control.
* Education and information, i.e. one of our key goals in game is to educate our players on political and economic models that were inspired by a real world
* Community cooperation, i.e. many activities in game require a mutual effort, cooperation and communication which makes the bonds between players even stronger More information on the Community Council will be available soon.

### Juridical entities <a href="#juridical-entities" id="juridical-entities"></a>

It is vital to be able to map the ideas around governance into proper legal frameworks and structures, and clear responsibilities among participants in the ecosystem.
