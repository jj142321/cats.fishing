Business Objectives, Market and Target Audience

Cats Fishing is not to be seen as a game for blockchain players. It is first a game for a large global audience of players in general. Absolutely no prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies is needed. Because of that, we compare mainly with the normal game market, and target the same players. A much bigger audience than previously seen in the field of blockchain gaming, and an associated larger opportunity for revenues.

### Market <a href="#market" id="market"></a>

#### Target Audience <a href="#target-audience" id="target-audience"></a>

We have made an analysis of the target market of the Inspiration games such as Animal Crossing. The conclusions are summarized in the table below. What is interesting is that we are competing in an underserved market. There are many female gamers, but relatively few games specifically made for them.

This is what is said about Animal Crossing:

> “What I find interesting is that the 3DS core users consist of 69% male and 31% female, but when I look at the numbers of people that bought Animal Crossing: New Leaf and the 3DS handheld together recently, I see 44% male and 56% female users. It’s quite an astonishing figure..”

#### Inspiration <a href="#inspiration" id="inspiration"></a>

By looking at what inspires the game, as well as what similar games are out there, we can see the commercial opportunities.

**Creative Inspiration**

Here is what the creative designer mentions as inspiration for the game itself, gameplay and art.

**Animal Crossing** (Game)

The game takes inspiration from animal crossing island ownership. The ability to socialize with friends and express creative freedom. Also daily tasks and activities such as fishing and farming.

**Minecraft** (Game)

Inspiration from building mechanics, farming and other activities within the game.

**Stardew Valley** (Game)

The freedom of choice, and open-ended gameplay, where the player chooses what they want to do. Optional side quests.

**Pettson och Findus** (Game & TV Series)

The playful art and music from Pettson and Findus, as well as some of the “mini-games” presented in the game. Pettson and Findus is a series of children's books written and illustrated by Swedish author Sven Nordqvist, portraying a countryside. The books have worldwide book sales of over 15 million and have been translated into 55 languages.

**Townscraper** (Game)

The technicalities of procedural island building and the minimalistic graphical style.

**Commercial Inspiration**

We have observed a great success of creative games, of builder games, of cute games, of farming games, of multiplayer games. Also the ideas for Cats Fishing is prime on the spot with the trends. The Economist explains it like this:

> "AMID THE economic devastation wrought by covid-19, video games are a rare bright spot. This year, the shares of Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, two big games publishers, have risen by 33% and 42%, respectively. Capcom, a Japanese video-game maker, is up by 75%. It is little wonder that the sector is so hot. Video games—especially live multiplayer ones that can be replayed endlessly—are great for staving off boredom. They are an increasingly popular way to connect with friends, too. During the pandemic, some enthusiasts have even used social games such as “Animal Crossing” to stage weddings, concerts and nightly talk shows."

So we believe in a fantastic potential. Here are some benchmarks:
