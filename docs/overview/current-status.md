My Neighbor Alice has been developed during 2020, and now has several key components done. See this demo to see what we have: a multiplayer, blockchain enabled game with landscape editor, chat, dialogues, map and really cute cows. If you react to the hexadecimal public keys shown, the game will soon have a completely different onboarding process, this is only for the demo. Besides that, if we only can make those cows stop rolling around, then we can launch.
