Cats Fishing is the first attempt to create a truly public application with an exciting plot that would attract first ordinary players, secondly blockchain enthusiasts and DeFi nerds. It has a light and intuitive interface with a variety of features to explore. In Cats Fishing, only you will decide on how much you want to be involved in the game's decentralised features and DeFi. Moreover, we designed the game in a way to make it “live forever” with a narrative that never becomes boring.
