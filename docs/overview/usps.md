**What sets this project apart?**

* We are in a very interesting time period where procedural building games start trending.
* There are very few interesting building games that incorporate blockchain technology.
* The style can be uniquely identified. The game philosophy is memorable. I.e, we use “Alice” as a central figure in the game to connect the users to a “fantasized neighborhood”. Human psychology likes relatability. Cute sells.
* The blockchain infrastructure is “hidden” for players who are not interested in the underlying technology. They will use it without seeing complex wallets or long sequence of meaningless text. We want to attract regular players who want to enjoy the gameplay experience. But for those interested in diving deeper into the game, there is a space for blockchain enthusiasts as well.
* Rich NFT DeFi functionalities as mentioned in this document, among others collateralized NFT and collateral based loans.
* The governance model and the DAO aspects are interesting not only to players and investors, but can also be interesting to mainstream media.
