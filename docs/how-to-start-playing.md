# How to Start Playing

Learn how you can start playing Cats Fishing!

Ready to embark on a decentralized journey of Web3? Let's get you started playing Cats Fishing!

Cats Fishing is currently in **Alpha**! This means that the game is only available to play for the public in so-called Seasons! These are announced ahead of time via our Social Channels so keep an eye on them! ðŸ‘€

Once a Season is live, you'll require a few things to play:

* A Web3 Wallet
* Connect to Cats Fishing website
* Get Access with an NFT
* Download the Game or play the web version

### Set up our Web3 Wallet <a href="#set-up-our-web3-wallet" id="set-up-our-web3-wallet"></a>

Before playing, you need a wallet. This holds all your cryptocurrency and enables you to manage your items and digital assets such as NFTs and Fishing Kit!

There are a few options when it comes to wallets, and we'll go through the most common ones:

#### Phantom Wallet <a href="#venly-wallet" id="venly-wallet"></a>

The easiest option is to use a Phantom Wallet. With this you create an account that allows you to login with social credentials, for example from Google, Apple or Facebook!

We've written a handy guide which you can find here:

[https://phantom.app/learn/guides/how-to-create-a-new-wallet](https://phantom.app/learn/guides/how-to-create-a-new-wallet)

#### MetaMask Wallet <a href="#metamask-wallet" id="metamask-wallet"></a>

Another popular wallet in the Web3 world is MetaMask. It's a browser extension that gives you full ownership over all your assets and cryptocurrencies.
