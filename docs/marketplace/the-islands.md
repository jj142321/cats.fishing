One of the great features is the [Map â†—](https://play.myneighboralice.com/map/). You can view the position of your land on the map and see which land plots are already owned or available for sale.

On the map, you can find land plots that are 'On sale'. Select one of them, view details, and proceed directly to its listing by clicking ['Buy plot on the marketplace'](https://docs.myneighboralice.com/marketplace/buy-and-sell-land-and-items).
