Starting from the relaunch of ALPHA SEASON 3 on August 29, My Neighbor Alice is making your gameplay even smoother. Introducing Venly, a blockchain technology tool that enables smart contracts and distributed ledger functions.

With Venly, making a digital wallet is easy. Just use your preferred login option, like Google or Facebook. Once set up, you can explore things like tokens, NFTs, and other digital items. Venly sets up a wallet for you, so you don’t have to do the hard work. Link it to your social account or email. To access, just log in and use a PIN. Simple and quick!

So why the change? It’s all about enhancing your experience. Let’s break down how you can use this in our Marketplace and the Chromia Launcher.

**Log-in steps: Marketplace via Venly**

1. Use the [Marketplace link](https://market.myneighboralice.com/market/) that you normally would for My Neighbor Alice.
2. Find and click on the “Connect Wallet” button.
3. In the pop-up, click on the “Venly” button.
4. Choose “Log in with (your preferred Social account)”. You’ll need to make an account if you’re not on Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Apple.
5. After logging in, you’ll see the “Connect your wallet” pop-up again. Click on the “Venly (Sign) button”.
6. A Venly Confirmation will pop up. Click “Submit”.
7. Lastly, punch in your Venly Wallet pin and hit “Confirm”.

**Log-in steps: Chromia Launcher via Venly**

3. A “Sign in with Chromia SSO” pop-up will appear. Click on “Venly”.
4. Select “Log in with (your preferred Social account)” like before. Set up an account if you need to.
5. After logging in, a “Chromia SSO Authentication” pop-up will show up. Click “Login to game account”.
6. In the Venly Confirmation popup, click “Submit”.
7. Type in your Venly Wallet pin and click “Confirm”.
8. Heads up: You might have to manually return to the Chromia Launcher since the redirect isn’t automatic.
