We are excited to introduce Crafting as a brand-new feature for Alpha Season 3. The game will take on a whole new level due to this innovation, allowing players to build, personalize, and modify their gameplay like never before. So, let’s dive into the details of this new feature!

Crafting is a mechanic that allows players to create various items using blueprints or tickets, which serve as recipes and licenses. Players can engage in activities such as fishing and farming to gather the necessary resources. Once they have the required resources, players can use a crafting table to create their items, which will appear in their inventory.

These crafted items can enhance your gameplay experience by placing them on your land or wearing them on your avatar. However, it is essential to know that trading assets among players will not be possible in Season 3, but we are working on implementing this feature in Season 4.

**Multi-Tier Crafting System**

The crafting system in My Neighbor Alice Alpha Season 3 is divided into two tiers with different complexity levels, making it accessible and challenging for all players:

1. TIER 1: In-game resources ONLY (In-Game currency called Björn Tokens / Resources)
2. TIER 2: $ALICE Tokens are needed

The value of an item determines its tier, with rarer items belonging to TIER 2. For example, a table would be a TIER 1 item, while a fountain would be TIER 2, assuming the fountain is perceived as rare.

**Item Transfers and NFTs**

Crafting items with $ALICE tokens (TIER 2) also grants them the status of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These NFTs can be unlocked at the end of Season 3, allowing players to partially or fully reclaim their $ALICE tokens.

**Crafting Complexity Levels**

The crafting system offers a range of complexity levels to cater to players of different skills and interests:

* Lower levels: Simple items such as fences, tables, barrels, tiles, and walls

Please note that Alice tokens are required for higher-tier Crafting, with the highest tier reserved exclusively for players using $Alice tokens.

Since the crafting feature in Alpha Season 3 of My Neighbor Alice is quite new and innovative, some technical problems could come up. We recommend that players start with smaller amounts of $ALICE when crafting to avoid issues. Based on our calculations, it’s estimated that the maximum amount of $ALICE one address can spend on crafting in Season 3 is 2500 $ALICE. However, most players will likely use much less than that.

$ALICE tokens on the Appnet are used specifically for in-game actions. If you want to trade these tokens, transfer them back to Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Users can transfer their $ALICE tokens from the Appnet to Binance Smart Chain whenever they want, but please note that these requests will take around 72 hours to process. The processing time is based on the block production of Binance Smart Chain so the actual duration may be a little shorter or longer than 72 hours.

In conclusion, the introduction of Crafting in My Neighbor Alice Alpha Season 3 is set to revolutionize the gaming experience, offering endless possibilities for creativity and customization.

We can’t wait to see what beautiful creations our players come up with! Stay tuned for more updates regarding the new season to be released!
