### Sign in by connecting a wallet <a href="#id-9555" id="id-9555"></a>

Please keep in mind that to use the Marketplace, you will need to have a crypto wallet. We recommend [Venly](https://docs.myneighboralice.com/how-to-articles/login-with-venly-wallet) for beginners and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) for advanced players.

**What is a wallet?**

Wallets are a new way to sign in and store digital assets like $ALICE tokens and NFTs. Instead of creating new accounts, just connect your wallet.
