# DAO & Governance

Imagine a game that can not be shut down, lives forever, where players control the project. A new way to implement games, challenging old models of doing business.

My Neighbor Alice will push the boundaries of blockchain gaming by letting the users control the game and development. A public democratic application, with formal control by players and other stakeholders such as investors.

### Community Council, or DAO <a href="#community-council-or-dao" id="community-council-or-dao"></a>

My Neighbor Alice will be a decentralized organization called Community Council, a digital democracy and mini-universe. This could not have been possible without blockchain, since we now can implement rules that govern what source code is running. This is an embodiment of the Chromia vision of public applications.

### Free and open source <a href="#free-and-open-source" id="free-and-open-source"></a>

The source code will have an open source license so users can control and ultimately fork the application. Note that this game depends on Unity, which is a non-free platform.

### Logic on-chain <a href="#logic-on-chain" id="logic-on-chain"></a>

The running game will be on the blockchain, as much as possible, thus avoiding the situation where a single entity controls the server.
