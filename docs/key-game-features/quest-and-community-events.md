# Quest & Community Events

One of our key values in the game is to create the atmosphere of friendship and common interests. The ultimate purpose in My Neighbor Alice is to create an alternative beautiful world where anyone can play, find friends and work together. Thus, My Neighbor Alice will enable various possibilities for players to work on a shared goal and join resources to complete fun activities. The game will also have community-created events where players will be able to create and participate in activities.
